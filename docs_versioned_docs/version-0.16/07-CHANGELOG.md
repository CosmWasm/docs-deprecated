## [0.14.0] - 2021-05-03 {#0140---2021-05-03}

### Added {#added}

- cosmwasm-crypto: Add `ed25519_batch_verify`, EdDSA ed25519 batch signature verification scheme for Tendermint
  signatures and public keys formats.
  ([#788])
- cosmwasm-crypto: Add `ed25519_verify`, EdDSA ed25519 signature verification scheme for Tendermint signature and public
  key formats. ([#771])
- cosmwasm-crypto: New crypto-related crate. Add `secp256k1_verify`, ECDSA secp256k1 signature verification scheme for
  Cosmos signature and public key formats. ([#780])
- cosmwasm-vm: Add PinnedMemoryCache. ([#696])
- cosmwasm-vm: The new `Cache::analyze` provides a static analyzis of the Wasm bytecode. This is used to tell the caller
  if the contract exposes IBC entry points. ([#736])
- cosmwasm-vm: Added new `stargate` feature flag to enable new stargate and ibc features ([#692], [#716])
- cosmwasm-vm: (requires `stargate`) call into 6 new ibc entry points if exposed by contract ([#692], [#716])
- cosmwasm-std: Added new `stargate` feature flag to enable new stargate and ibc features ([#692], [#706])
- cosmwasm-std: (requires `stargate`) Added new `CosmosMsg::Stargate` message type to dispatch protobuf-encoded
  message (contract must know proto schema)
  ([#706])
- cosmwasm-std: (requires `stargate`) Added new `QueryRequest::Stargate` message type to dispatch protobuf-encoded
  queries (contract must know proto schema for request and response) ([#706])
- cosmwasm-std: (requires `stargate`) Added new `CosmosMsg::Ibc(IbcMsg)` message type to use ibctransfer app or send raw
  ics packets (if contract has ibc entry points) ([#692], [#710])
- cosmwasm-std: Add mutable helper methods to `InitResponse`, `MigrateResponse`
  and `HandleResponse` which make `Context` obsolete.
- contracts: added new `ibc-reflect` contract that receives channels and assigns each an account to redispatch. Similar
  idea to ICS27/Interchain Accounts (but different implementation) ([#692], [#711], [#714])
- cosmwasm-std: Added new `WasmMsg::Migrate` variant that allows one contract
  (eg. multisig) be the admin and migrate another contract ([#768])
- cosmwasm-std: Added optional `system` entry point that can only be called by native (blockchain) modules to expose
  admin functionality if desired. ([#793])
- cosmwasm-std: Add extra field `submessages` to `Response`, such that you can get a callback from these messages after
  their execution (success or failure).
  ([#796])
- cosmwasm-std: Added `reply` entry point that will receive all callbacks from submessages dispatched by this contract.
  This is only required if contract returns "submessages" (above). ([#796])
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `From<Uint128> for String`, `From<Uint128> for u128`
  as well as `From<u{32,16,8}> for Uint128`.
- cosmwasm-std: Create new address type `Addr`. This is human readable (like
  `HumanAddr`) but is immutable and always contains a valid address ([#802]).
- cosmwasm-vm: Add import `addr_validate` ([#802]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `BankMsg::Burn` variant when you want the tokens to disappear ([#860])
- cosmwasm-std: Create `Fraction<T>` trait to represent a fraction `p`/`q` with integers `p` and `q`. `Decimal` now
  implements `Fraction<u128>`, which provides public getters `::numerator()` and `::denominator()`.
- cosmwasm-std: Add `Decimal::inv` that returns `1/d` for decimal `d`.
- cosmwasm-vm: Add `Cache::metrics` to expose internal data for monitoring purposes ([#763]).
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `PartialOrd` and `Ord` for `Binary` using the same lexicographical ordering as implemented
  by `Vec<u8>`.
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `PartialOrd` and `Ord` for `Addr` using the same lexicographical ordering as implemented
  by `String`.
- cosmwasm-std: Added new `WasmMsg::UpdateAdmin` variant that allows an admin contract (eg. multisig) to set another
  admin ([#900])
- cosmwasm-std: Added new `WasmMsg::ClearAdmin` variant that allows an admin contract (eg. multisig) to clear the admin,
  to prevent future migrations
  ([#900])
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `Display for Coin` ([#901]).
- cosmwasm-std: Create `Uint64` analogously to `Uint128` with string serialization allowing the use of the full uint64
  range in JSON clients that use float numbers, such as JavaScript and jq.
- cosmwasm-std: Create const functions `Uint64::new` and `Uint128::new` to create instances in a const context.

### Changed {#changed}

- contracts: Rename `HandleMsg` to `ExecuteMsg`.
- all: Rename `handle` entry point to `execute`.
- all: Rename `init` entry point to `instantiate`.
- all: Rename `system` entry point to `sudo`.
- all: Drop support for Rust versions lower than 1.51.0.
- all: The `query` and `execute` entry points are now optional. It is still highly recommended to implement and expose
  them in almost any use case though.
- all: Change the encoding of the key/value region of the `db_next` import to a more generic encoding that supports an
  arbitrary number of sections. This encoding can then be reused for other multi value regions.
- all: Remove the `info: MessageInfo` argument from the `migrate` entry point
  ([#690]).
- cosmwasm-std: Remove `from_address` from `BankMsg::Send`, as it always sends from the contract address, and this is
  consistent with other `CosmosMsg`
  variants.
- cosmwasm-std: Remove the previously deprecated `InitResult`, `HandleResult`,
  `MigrateResult` and `QueryResult` in order to make error type explicit and encourage migration to custom errors.
- cosmwasm-std: Add a `data` field to `InitResponse` the same way as in
  `MigrateResponse` and `HandleResponse`.
- cosmwasm-std: Rename `MessageInfo::sent_funds` to `MessageInfo::funds`.
- cosmwasm-std: Merge response types `InitResponse`, `HandleResponse` and
  `MigrateResponse` into the new `Response`.
- cosmwasm-std: Remove `Default` implementation from `HumanAddr`,
  `CanonicalAddr`, `ContractInfo`, `MessageInfo`, `BlockInfo` and `Env`. If you need one of those, you're probably doing
  something wrong.
- cosmwasm-std: Make `label` in `WasmMsg::Instantiate` non-optional to better match the Go/database format.
- cosmwasm-std: Add new field `admin` to `WasmMsg::Instantiate` to fully support
  `MsgInstantiateContract` from `x/wasm` ([#861]).
- cosmwasm-std: `Binary::to_array` is now generic over the array length instead of the output type. As a consequence the
  obsolete type `ByteArray` was removed. The array length is not restricted to 0-64 anymore.
- cosmwasm-std: Use const generics to implement `From<&[u8; LENGTH]> for Binary`
  and `From<[u8; LENGTH]> for Binary`, such that the array length is not restricted to 0-64 anymore.
- cosmwasm-vm: Avoid serialization of Modules in `InMemoryCache`, for performance. Also, remove `memory_limit`
  from `InstanceOptions`, and define it instead at `Cache` level (same memory limit for all cached instances).
  ([#697])
- cosmwasm-std: Rename type `KV` to `Pair` in order to comply to naming convention as enforced by clippy
  rule `upper_case_acronyms` from Rust 1.51.0 on.
- cosmwasm-std: `ContractInfo::address` and `MessageInfo::sender` are now of type `Addr`. The value of those fields is
  created by the host and thus valid.
- cosmwasm-vm: Bump required marker export `cosmwasm_vm_version_4` to
  `interface_version_5`.
- cosmwasm-vm: Rename trait `Api` to `BackendApi` to better express this is the API provided by the VM's backend (i.e.
  the blockchain).
- cosmwasm-vm: Rename imports to `addr_canonicalize` and `addr_humanize`
  ([#802]).
- cosmwasm-vm: Replace types `HumanAddr`/`CanonicalAddr` with
  `&str`/`String`/`&[u8]`/`Vec<u8>` in the methods of `BackendApi`. The address types belong in the contract development
  and the backend operates on raw strings and binary anyways.
- contracts: `reflect` contract requires `stargate` feature and supports redispatching `Stargate` and `IbcMsg::Transfer`
  messages ([#692])
- cosmwasm-std: The arithmetic methods of `Uint128` got a huge overhaul, making them more consistent with the bahaviour
  of the Rust primitive types. Thank you
  [@yihuang] for bringing this up and for the great implementation. ([#853])
  1. `Uint128` got the new functions `checked_add`, `checked_sub`,
     `checked_mul`, `checked_div`, `checked_div_euclid`, `checked_rem`,
     `wrapping_add`, `wrapping_sub`, `wrapping_mul`, `wrapping_pow`,
     `saturating_add`, `saturating_sub`, `saturating_mul` and `saturating_pow`
     which match their equivalent in [u128] except that instead of `Option` the checked methods return a `Result` with
     an `OverflowError` or
     `DivideByZeroError` that carries a few debug information and can directly be converted to `StdError`/`StdResult` by
     using the `?` operator.
  2. `StdError::Underflow` and `StdError::underflow` were removed in favour of
     `StdError::Overflow`. `StdError::DivideByZeroError` was added.
  3. The `-` operator (`impl ops::Sub<Uint128> for Uint128`) was removed because it returned a `StdResult` instead of
     panicking in the case of an overflow. This behaviour was inconsistent with `+` and the Rust standard library.
     Please use the explicit `*_sub` methods introduced above. In a couple of releases from now, we want to introduce
     the operator again with panicking overflow behaviour ([#858]).
- cosmwasm-std: Replace `HumanAddr` with `String` in `BankQuery`, `StakingQuery`
  and `WasmQuery` query requests ([#802]).
- cosmwasm-std: In staking query response types `Delegation`, `FullDelegation`
  and `Validator` the validator address fields were changed from `HumanAddr` to
  `String`. The new `Addr` type cannot be used here because it only supports standard account addresses
  via `Api::addr_*` ([#871]).
- cosmwasm-std: Change address types in `BankMsg`, `IbcMsg` and `WasmMsg` from
  `HumanAddr` to `String` ([#802]).
- cosmwasm-std: `Api::addr_humanize` now returns `Addr` instead of `HumanAddr`
  ([#802]).
- cosmwasm-std: Hide `StakingMsg`, `CosmosMsg::Staking`,
  `AllDelegationsResponse`, `BondedDenomResponse`, `Delegation`,
  `FullDelegation`, `StakingQuery`, `Validator`, `ValidatorsResponse` and
  `testing::StakingQuerier` behind the `staking` feature flag to make those only available in contracts built for PoS
  chains.
- cosmwasm-std: Remove `StakingMsg::Withdraw` in favour of
  `DistributionMsg::SetWithdrawAddress` and
  `DistributionMsg::WithdrawDelegatorReward` ([#848]).
- cosmwasm-std: Rename `StakingQuery::Validators`, `ValidatorsResponse` and
  `QuerierWrapper::query_validators` to `StakingQuery::AllValidators`,
  `AllValidatorsResponse` and `QuerierWrapper.query_all_validators`. Add
  `StakingQuery::Validator`, `ValidatorResponse` and
  `QuerierWrapper::query_validator` to allow querying a single validator.
  ([#879])
- cosmwasm-schema: Make first argument non-mutable in `export_schema_with_title`
  for consistency with `export_schema`.
- cosmwasm-std: The block time in `BlockInfo::time` is now a `Timestamp`.
  `BlockInfo::time_nanos` was removed.

### Deprecated {#deprecated}

- cosmwasm-std: `InitResponse`, `MigrateResponse` and `HandleResponse` are deprecated in favour of the new `Response`.
- cosmwasm-std: `Context` is deprecated in favour of the new mutable helpers in
  `Response`.
- cosmwasm-std: `HumanAddr` is not much more than an alias to `String` and it does not provide significant safety
  advantages. With CosmWasm 0.14, we now use
  `String` when there was `HumanAddr` before. There is also the new `Addr`, which holds a validated immutable human
  readable address. ([#802])

### Added {#added-1}

- cosmwasm-std: Add the new `#[entry_point]` macro attribute that serves as an alternative implementation
  to `cosmwasm_std::create_entry_points!(contract)`
  and `cosmwasm_std::create_entry_points_with_migration!(contract)`. Both ways are supported in the 0.13 series.

## [0.13.0] – 2021-01-06 {#0130--2021-01-06}

## Added {#added-2}

- cosmwasm-std: Extend binary to array support to 64 bytes.

  instead.

## 0.12.1 (2020-12-09) {#0121-2020-12-09}

**cosmwasm-std**

- Deprecate `InitResult`, `HandleResult`, `MigrateResult` and `QueryResult` in order to make error type explicit an
  encourage migration to custom errors.
- Implement `Deref` for `QuerierWrapper`, such that `QuerierWrapper` behaves like a smart pointer to `Querier` allowing
  you to access `Querier` methods directly.

## 0.12.0 (2020-11-19) {#0120-2020-11-19}

**cosmwasm-std**

- Remove the previously deprecated `StdError::Unauthorized`. Contract specific errors should be implemented using custom
  error types now (see
  [migration guide](06-MIGRATING.md) 0.10 -> 0.11).
- Use dependency `thiserror` instead of `snafu` to implement `StdError`. Along with this change, the `backtraces`
  feature now requires Rust nightly.
- Rename `StdError::ParseErr::source` to `StdError::ParseErr::source_type` and
  `StdError::SerializeErr::target` to `StdError::SerializeErr::target_type` to work around speacial treatment of the
  field name `source` in thiserror.
- Rename `Extern` to `Deps` to unify naming.
- Simplify ownership of calling `handle`, etc. with `Deps` and `DepsMut` struct that just contains references (`DepsMut`
  has `&mut Storage` otherwise the same)
- Remove unused `Deps::change_querier`. If you need this or similar functionality, create a new struct with the right
  querier.
- Remove `ReadonlyStorage`. You can just use `Storage` everywhere. And use
  `&Storage` to provide readonly access. This was only needed to let
  `PrefixedStorage`/`ReadonlyPrefixedStorage` implement the common interface, which is something we don't need.

**cosmwasm-storage**

- `PrefixedStorage`/`ReadonlyPrefixedStorage` do not implement the
  `Storage`/`ReadonlyStorage` traits anymore. If you need nested prefixes, you need to construct them directly
  via `PrefixedStorage::multilevel` and
  `ReadonlyPrefixedStorage::multilevel`.
- Remove unused `TypedStorage`. If you need this or similar functionality, you probably want to use `Bucket`
  or `Singleton`. If you really need it, please copy the v0.11 code into your project.
- Remove `StorageTransaction` along with `transactional` and `RepLog`. This has not been used actively for contract
  development and is now maintained in a contract testing framework.

**cosmwasm-vm**

- Remove `Storage::range` and `StorageIterator`. The storage implementation is now responsible for maintaining iterators
  internally and make them accessible via the new `Storage::scan` and `Storage::next` methods.
- Add `FfiError::IteratorDoesNotExist`. Looking at this, `FfiError` should probably be renamed to something that
  includes before, on and behind the FFI boundary to Go.
- `MockStorage` now implementes the new `Storage` trait and has an additional
  `MockStorage::all` for getting all elements of an iterator in tests.
- Remove unused `Extern::change_querier`. If you need this or similar functionality, create a new struct with the right
  querier.
- Let `Instance::from_code` and `CosmCache::get_instance` take options as an
  `InstanceOptions` struct. This contains `gas_limit` and `print_debug` for now and can easily be
  extended. `cosmwasm_vm::testing::mock_instance_options` can be used for creating such a struct in integration tests.
- Make `FileSystemCache` crate internal. This should be used via `CosmCache`.
- Fix return type of `FileSystemCache::load` to `VmResult<Option<Module>>` in order to differentiate missing files from
  errors.
- Add in-memory caching for recently used Wasm modules.
- Rename `CosmCache` to just `cosmwasm_vm::Cache` and add `CacheOptions` to configure it.
- Rename `Extern` to `Backend`.
- Rename `mock_dependencies` to `mock_backend` and
  `mock_dependencies_with_balances` to `mock_backend_with_balances`.
- Rename `FfiError`/`FfiResult` to `BackendError`/`BackendResult` and adapt
  `VmError` accordingly.

## 0.11.2 (2020-10-26) {#0112-2020-10-26}

**cosmwasm-std**

- Implement `From<std::str::Utf8Error>` and `From<std::string::FromUtf8Error>`
  for `StdError`.
- Generalize denom argument from `&str` to `S: Into<String>` in `coin`, `coins`
  and `Coin::new`.
- Implement `PartialEq` between `Binary` and `Vec<u8>`/`&[u8]`.
- Add missing `PartialEq` implementations between `HumanAddr` and `str`/`&str`.
- Add `Binary::to_array`, which allows you to copy binary content into a fixed-length `u8` array. This is espeically
  useful for creating integers from binary data.

## 0.11.1 (2020-10-12) {#0111-2020-10-12}

**cosmwasm-std**

- Implement `Hash` and `Eq` for `Binary` to allow using `Binary` in `HashSet`
  and `HashMap`.
- Implement `Hash` and `Eq` for `CanonicalAddr` to allow using `CanonicalAddr`
  in `HashSet` and `HashMap`.
- Implement `Add`, `AddAssign` and `Sub` with references on the right hand side for `Uint128`.
- Implement `Sum<Uint128>` and `Sum<&'a Uint128>` for `Uint128`.

## 0.11.0 (2020-10-08) {#0110-2020-10-08}

**all**

- Drop support for Rust versions lower than 1.45.2.
- The serialization of the result from `init`/`migrate`/`handle`/`query` changed in an incompatible way. See the
  new `ContractResult` and `SystemResult` types and their documentation.
- Pass `Env` into `query` as well. As this doesn't have `MessageInfo`, we removed `MessageInfo` from `Env` and pass that
  as a separate argument to
  `init`, `handle`, and `query`. See the example
  [type definitions in the README](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/master/README.md#implementing-the-smart-contract)
  to see how to update your contract exports (just add one extra arg each).

**cosmwasm-std**

- Add `time_nanos` to `BlockInfo` allowing access to high precision block times.
- Change `FullDelegation::accumulated_rewards` from `Coin` to `Vec<Coin>`.
- Rename `InitResponse::log`, `MigrateResponse::log` and `HandleResponse::log`
  to `InitResponse::attributes`, `MigrateResponse::attributes` and
  `HandleResponse::attributes`.
- Rename `LogAttribute` to `Attribute`.
- Rename `log` to `attr`.
- Rename `Context::add_log` to `Context::add_attribute`.
- Add `Api::debug` for emitting debug messages during development.
- Fix error type for response parsing errors in `ExternalQuerier::raw_query`. This was `Ok(Err(StdError::ParseErr))`
  instead of
  `Err(SystemError::InvalidResponse)`, implying an error created in the target contract.
- Deprecate `StdError::Unauthorized` and `StdError::unauthorized` in favour of custom errors. From now on `StdError`
  should only be created by the standard library and should only contain cases the standard library needs.
- Let `impl Display for CanonicalAddr` use upper case hex instead of base64. This also
  affects `CanonicalAddr::to_string`.
- Create trait `CustomQuery` for the generic argument in
  `QueryRequest<C: CustomQuery>`. This allows us to provide
  `impl<C: CustomQuery> From<C> for QueryRequest<C>` for any custom query.
- Implement `From<Binary> for Vec<u8>`.
- Implement `From<CanonicalAddr> for Vec<u8>`.
- Add `Binary::into_vec` and `CanonicalAddr::into_vec`.
- The `canonical_length` argument was removed from `mock_dependencies`,
  `mock_dependencies_with_balances`. In the now deprecated `MockApi::new`, the argument is unused. Contracts should not
  need to set this value and usually should not make assumptions about the value.
- The canonical address encoding in `MockApi::canonical_address` and
  `MockApi::human_address` was changed to an unpredicatable represenation of non-standard length that aims to destroy
  most of the input structure.

**cosmwasm-storage**

- Change order of arguments such that `storage` is always first followed by namespace in `Bucket::new`
  , `Bucket::multilevel`, `ReadonlyBucket::new`,
  `ReadonlyBucket::multilevel`, `bucket` and `bucket_read`.
- Change order of arguments such that `storage` is always first followed by namespace in `PrefixedStorage::new`
  , `PrefixedStorage::multilevel`,
  `ReadonlyPrefixedStorage::new`, `ReadonlyPrefixedStorage::multilevel`,
  `prefixed` and `prefixed_read`.

**cosmwasm-vm**

- `CosmCache::new`, `Instance::from_code` and `Instance::from_module` now take an additional argument to enable/disable
  printing debug logs from contracts.
- Bump required export `cosmwasm_vm_version_3` to `cosmwasm_vm_version_4`.
- The `canonical_length` argument was removed from `mock_dependencies`,
  `mock_dependencies_with_balances` and `MockApi::new_failing`. In the now deprecated `MockApi::new`, the argument is
  unused. Contracts should not need to set this value and usually should not make assumptions about the value.
- The canonical address encoding in `MockApi::canonical_address` and
  `MockApi::human_address` was changed to an unpredicatable represenation of non-standard length that aims to destroy
  most of the input structure.

## 0.10.1 (2020-08-25) {#0101-2020-08-25}

**cosmwasm-std**

- Fix bug where `ExternalStorage.range()` would cause VM error if either lower or upper bound was set
  ([#508](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/508))

## 0.10.0 (2020-07-30) {#0100-2020-07-30}

**all**

- Drop support for Rust versions lower than 1.44.1.

**cosmwasm-std**

- Remove error helpers `generic_err`, `invalid_base64`, `invalid_utf8`,
  `not_found`, `parse_err`, `serialize_err`, `underflow`, `unauthorized` in favour of `StdError::generic_err` and
  friends.
- Implement `From<&[u8; $N]> for Binary` and `From<[u8; $N]> for Binary` for all
  `$N <= 32`.
- Add `Context` object that can be used to build Init/Handle/Migrate response via `add_log`, `add_message`, `set_data`
  and then convert to the proper type via `into` or `try_into`. Option to simplify response construction.
- Env uses `HumanAddr` for `message.sender` and `contract_address`
- Remove `Api` argument from `mock_env`
- Implement `From<&[u8]>` and `From<Vec<u8>>` for `CanonicalAddr`

**cosmwasm-vm**

- Remove unused cache size argument from `CosmCache`.
- `set_gas_limit` now panics if the given gas limit exceeds the max. supported value.
- Increase the max. supported value for gas limit from 10_000_000_000 to 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.
- Add checks to `get_region` for failing early when the contract sends a Region pointer to the VM that is not backed by
  a plausible Region. This helps development of standard libraries.
- Create dedicated `RegionValidationError` and `RegionValidationResult`.
- `Api::human_address` and `Api::canonical_address` now return a pair of return data and gas usage.
- Remove `NextItem` in favour of a more advanced `FfiResult<T>`, which is used to store the return result and the gas
  information consistently across all APIs. `FfiResult<T>` was changed to `(Result<T, FfiError>, GasInfo)`.
- Create error type `FfiError::InvalidUtf8` for the cases where the backend sends invalid UTF-8 in places that expect
  strings.
- Remove `FfiError::Other` in favour of `FfiError::UserErr` and
  `FfiError::Unknown`.
- The `canonicalize_address` and `humanize_address` imports now report user errors to the contract.
- Bump `cosmwasm_vm_version_2` to `cosmwasm_vm_version_3`.
- `Querier::raw_query` and `QuerierResult` were removed in favour of the new
  `Querier::query_raw`, which includes a gas limit parameter for the query.

## 0.9.4 (2020-07-16) {#094-2020-07-16}

**cosmwasm-vm**

- Add `Instance::create_gas_report` returning a gas report including the original limit, the remaining gas and the
  internally/externally used gas.

## 0.9.3 (2020-07-08) {#093-2020-07-08}

**cosmwasm-storage**

- Add `.remove()` method to `Bucket` and `Singleton`.

## 0.9.2 (2020-06-29) {#092-2020-06-29}

- Downgrade wasmer to 0.17.0.

## 0.9.1 (2020-06-25) {#091-2020-06-25}

**cosmwasm-std**

- Replace type `Never` with `Empty` because enums with no cases cannot be expressed in valid JSON Schema.

## 0.9.0 (2020-06-25) {#090-2020-06-25}

Note: this version contains an API bug and should not be used (see
https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/451).

**all**

- Upgrade wasmer to 0.17.1.
- Drop support for Rust versions lower than 1.43.1

**cosmwasm-std**

- `ReadonlyStorage::get` and all its implementations now return
  `Option<Vec<u8>>`.
- `ReadonlyStorage::range` and all its implementations now always succeed and return an iterator instead of a result.
  This is now an iterator over
  `Option<KV>` instead of `Option<StdResult<KV>>`.
- `Storage::{set, remove}` and all their implementations no longer have a return value. Previously they
  returned `StdResult<()>`.
- Trait `Querier` is not `Clone` and `Send` anymore.
- `consume_region` panics on null pointers and returns `Vec<u8>` instead of
  `StdResult<Vec<u8>>`.
- Added contract migration mechanism. Contracts can now optionally export a
  `migrate` function with the following definition:
  ```rust
  extern "C" fn migrate(env_ptr: u32, msg_ptr: u32) -> u32;
  ```
- InitResponse no longer has a data field. We always return the contract address in the data field in the blockchain and
  don't allow you to override. `handle`
  can still make use of the field.
- Rename `MockQuerier::with_staking` to `MockQuerier::update_staking` to match
  `::update_balance`.
- The obsolete `StdError::NullPointer` and `null_pointer` were removed.
- Error creator functions are now in type itself, e.g.
  `StdError::invalid_base64` instead of `invalid_base64`. The free functions are deprecated and will be removed before
  1.0.

**cosmwasm-storage**

- Remove `transactional_deps`. Use `transactional` that just provides a transactional storage instead.
- `get_with_prefix` returns `Option<Vec<u8>>` instead of
  `StdResult<Option<Vec<u8>>>`.
- `set_with_prefix` and `remove_with_prefix` return nothing instead of
  `StdResult<()>`.
- `RepLog::commit` no longer returns any value (always succeeds).
- `Op::apply` no longer returns any value (always succeeds).

**cosmwasm-vm**

- The export `allocate` must not return 0 as a valid address. The contract is responsible for avoiding this offset in
  the linear memory.
- The import `db_read` now allocates memory for the return value as part of the call and returns a pointer to the value
  as `u32`. The return value 0 means
  _key does not exist_.
- The import `db_next` now allocates a memory region for the return key and value as part of the call and returns a
  pointer to the region as `u32`. The data in the region is stored in the format `value || key || keylen`. As before, an
  empty key means _no more value_.
- Remove `Instance::get_gas` in favour of `Instance::get_gas_left`.
- All calls from the VM layer to the chain layer also return the amount of gas used on success. (This is represented by
  replacing the return value with
  `(value, used_gas)`). Gas usage across the system is then tracked in the VM layer, which allows us to halt the
  contract during an import, as soon as we can prove that we used all allocated gas.
- Remove instance caching, which is disabled since 0.8.1 as it is not stable. Remove `CosmCache::store_instance`; you
  can not call `Instance::recylce`
  directly to get back the external dependencies.
- Rename `MockQuerier::with_staking` to `MockQuerier::update_staking` to match
  `::update_balance`.
- Instead of panicking, `read_region`/`write_region`/`get_region`/`set_region`
  now return a new `CommunicationError::DerefErr` when dereferencing a pointer provided by the contract fails.
- `FfiError::set_message` was removed because errors should be immutable. Use
  `FfiError::other` to create an error with the desired error message.
- The import implementation of `db_scan` now errors instead of returning an error code for an invalid order value. The
  return type was changed to `u32`.
- Remove `StorageIteratorItem` in favour of the new types `StorageIterator` and
  `NextItem`. `StorageIterator` is a custom iterator type that does not implement Rust's `Iterator` trait, allowing it
  to communicate the used gas value of the last `next` call to the VM.
- Don't report any `VmError` back to the contract in `canonicalize_address` and
  `humanize_address`. Only invalid inputs should be reported.
- Move error cases `VmError::RegionLengthTooBig` and `VmError::RegionTooSmall`
  into `CommunicationError`.
- In the `canonicalize_address` inplementation, invalid UTF-8 inputs now result in `CommunicationError::InvalidUtf8`,
  which is not reported back to the contract. A standard library should ensure this never happens by correctly encoding
  string input values.
- Merge trait `ReadonlyStorage` into `Storage`.
- The imports `canonicalize_address` and `humanize_address` now return a memory address to an error `Region`. If this
  address is 0, the call succeeded.
- Bump `cosmwasm_vm_version_1` to `cosmwasm_vm_version_2`.

## 0.8.1 (2020-06-08) {#081-2020-06-08}

**cosmwasm-std**

- The arguments of `log` changed from `&str` to `ToString`, allowing to pass various types like `String`, `HumanAddr`
  , `Uint128` or primitive integers directly.
- Add `From<Vec<u8>>` and `Into<Vec<u8>>` implementations for `Binary` for zero-copy conversions.

**cosmwasm-vm**

- Deprecated `Instance::get_gas` in favour of `Instance::get_gas_left`. The old method will remain available for a while
  but will issue a deprecation warning when used.
- Disable instance caching by treating every cache size as 0. Instance caching is not safe as the same Wasm memory is
  reused across multiple executions.
- The storage of an `Instance` can now be set into readonly mode, which is checked by the writing storage
  imports `db_write` and `db_remove`. Read-only mode is off by default for backwards compatibility. `call_query_raw` now
  sets the instance's storage to readonly.
- The new error case `VmError::WriteAccessDenied` is returned when a contract calls an import that potentially writes to
  storage during a query.

## 0.8.0 (2020-05-25) {#080-2020-05-25}

**all**

- Upgrade schemars to 0.7.
- Upgrade wasmer to 0.17.
- Update snafu to 0.6.
- Minimal supported Rust version is 1.41.
- Split `Region.len` into `Region.capacity` and `Region.length`, where the new capacity is the number of bytes available
  and `length` is the number of bytes used. This is a breaking change in the contract-vm interface, which requires the
  same memory layout of the `Region` struct on both sides.
- Add `remove` method to `Storage` trait.
- (feature-flagged) Add `range` method to `ReadonlyStorage` trait. This returns an iterator that covers all or a subset
  of the items in the db ordered ascending or descending by key.
- Add new feature flag `iterator` to both packages to enable `range`
  functionality. This is used to allow potential porting to chains that use Merkle Tries (which don't allow iterating
  over ranges).
- All serialized JSON types now use snake_case mappings for names. This means enum fields like `ChangeOwner` will map
  to `change_owner` in the underlying JSON, not `changeowner`. This is a breaking change for the clients.
- Public interface between contract and runtime no longer uses `String` to represent an error, but rather
  serializes `ApiError` as a rich JSON error.
- Return value from `env.write_db` and `env.remove_db` to allow error reporting.
- Query responses are now required to contain valid JSON.
- Renamed all `*_db` wasm imports to `db_*`
- Merge `cw-storage` repo as subpackage, now `cosmwasm-storage`
- Add iterator support to `cosmwasm-storage`
- `Coin.amount` is now `Uint128` rather than `String`. Uint128 serializes as a string in JSON, but parses into a u128
  data in memory. It also has some operator overloads to allow easy math operations on `Coin` types, as well as
  enforcing valid amounts.
- `Env` no longer has a `contract.balance` element. If you need this info, please use the `Querier` to get this info. As
  of Cosmos-SDK 0.39 this needs extra storage queries to get the balance, so we only do those queries when needed.
- `Env.message.sent_funds` is a `Vec<Coin>` not `Option<Vec<Coin>>`. We will normalize the go response in `go-cosmwasm`
  before sending it to the contract.
- `Env.message.signer` was renamed to `Env.message.sender`.
- `Env.block.{height,time}` are now `u64` rather than `i64`.

**cosmwasm-schema**

- This new crate now contains the implementations for generating JSON Schema files from interface types. It exposes the
  functions `export_schema`,
  `export_schema_with_title`, and `schema_for`.

**cosmwasm-std**

- Make all symbols from `cosmwasm::memory` crate internal, as those symbols are not needed by users of the library.
- Rename `cosmwasm::mock::dependencies` -> `cosmwasm::mock::mock_dependencies`
  to differentiate between testing and production `External`.
- Export all symbols from `cosmwasm::mock` as the new non-wasm32 module
  `cosmwasm::testing`. Export all remaining symbols at top level (e.g.
  `use cosmwasm::traits::{Api, Storage};` + `use cosmwasm::encoding::Binary;`
  becomes `use cosmwasm::{Api, Binary, Storage};`).
- Rename package `cosmwasm` to `cosmwasm-std`.
- The export `allocate` does not zero-fill the allocated memory anymore.
- Add `remove_db` to the required imports of a contract.
- (feature-flagged) add `scan_db` and `next_db` callbacks from wasm contract to VM.
- `serde::{from_slice, to_vec}` return `cosmwasm_std::Result`, no more need to use `.context(...)` when calling these
  functions
- Split `Response` into `InitResponse` and `HandleResponse`; split
  `ContractResult` into `InitResult` and `HandleResult`.
- Create explicit `QueryResponse`, analogue to `InitResponse` and
  `HandleResponse`.
- The exports `cosmwasm_vm_version_1`, `allocate` and `deallocate` are now private and can only be called via the Wasm
  export. Make sure to `use`
  `cosmwasm_std` at least once in the contract to pull in the C exports.
- Add `Querier` trait and `QueryRequest` for query callbacks from the contract, along with `SystemError` type for the
  runtime rejecting messages.
- `QueryRequest` takes a generic `Custom(T)` type that is passed opaquely to the end consumer (`wasmd` or integration
  test stubs), allowing custom queries to native code.
- `{Init,Handle,Query}Result` are now just aliases for a concrete `ApiResult`
  type.
- Support results up to 128 KiB in `ExternalStorage.get`.
- The `Storage` trait's `.get`, `.set` and `.remove` now return a `Result` to allow propagation of errors.
- Move `transactional`, `transactional_deps`, `RepLog`, `StorageTransaction`
  into crate `cosmwasm-storage`.
- Rename `Result` to `StdResult` to differentiate between the auto-`use`d
  `core::result::Result`. Fix error argument to `Error`.
- Complete overhaul of `Error` into `StdError`:
  - The `StdError` enum can now be serialized and deserialized (losing its backtrace), which allows us to pass them over
    the Wasm/VM boundary. This allows using fully structured errors in e.g. integration tests.
  - Auto generated snafu error constructor structs like `NotFound`/`ParseErr`/… have been intenalized in favour of error
    generation helpers like
    `not_found`/`parse_err`/…
  - All error generator functions now return errors instead of results.
  - Error cases don't contain `source` fields anymore. Instead source errors are converted to standard types
    like `String`. For this reason, both
    `snafu::ResultExt` and `snafu::OptionExt` cannot be used anymore.
  - Backtraces became optional. Use `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` to enable them.
  - `Utf8Err`/`Utf8StringErr` merged into `StdError::InvalidUtf8`
  - `Base64Err` renamed into `StdError::InvalidBase64`
  - `ContractErr`/`DynContractErr` merged into `StdError::GeneralErr`
  - The unused `ValidationErr` was removed
  - `StdError` is now
    [non_exhaustive](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.35.0/unstable-book/language-features/non-exhaustive.html), making new
    error cases non-breaking changes.
- `ExternalStorage.get` now returns an empty vector if a storage entry exists but has an empty value. Before, this was
  normalized to `None`.
- Reorganize `CosmosMsg` enum types. They are now split by modules:
  `CosmosMsg::Bank(BankMsg)`, `CosmosMsg::Custom(T)`, `CosmosMsg::Wasm(WasmMsg)`
- CosmosMsg is now generic over the content of `Custom` variant. This allows blockchains to support custom native calls
  in their Cosmos-SDK apps and developers to make use of them in CosmWasm apps without forking the
  `cosmwasm-vm` and `go-cosmwasm` runtime.
- Add `staking` feature flag to expose new `StakingMsg` types under `CosmosMsg`
  and new `StakingRequest` types under `QueryRequest`.
- Add support for mocking-out staking queries via `MockQuerier.with_staking`
- `from_slice`/`from_binary` now require result type to be `DeserializeOwned`, i.e. the result must not contain
  references such as `&str`.

**cosmwasm-vm**

- Make `Instance.memory`/`.allocate`/`.deallocate`/`.func` crate internal. A user of the VM must not access the
  instance's memory directly.
- The imports `env.canonicalize_address`, `env.humanize_address` and
  `env.read_db` don't return the number of bytes written anymore. This value is now available in the resulting regions.
  Negative return values are errors, 0 is success and values greater than 0 are reserved for future use.
- Change the required interface version guard export from `cosmwasm_api_0_6` to
  `cosmwasm_vm_version_1`.
- Provide implementations for `remove_db` and (feature-flagged) `scan_db` and
  `next_db`
- Provide custom `serde::{from_slice, to_vec}` implementation separate from
  `cosmwasm_std`, so we can return cosmwasm-vm specific `Result` (only used internally).
- `call_{init,handle,query}` and the `cosmwasm_vm::testing` wrappers return standard `Result` types now,
  eg. `Result<HandleResponse, ApiError>`.
- Add length limit when reading memory from the instance to protect against malicious contracts creating overly
  large `Region`s.
- Add `Instance.get_memory_size`, giving you the peak memory consumption of an instance.
- Remove `cosmwasm_vm::errors::CacheExt`.
- Move `cosmwasm_vm::errors::{Error, Result}` to
  `cosmwasm_vm::{VmError, VmResult}` and remove generic error type from result.
- The import `db_read` now returns an error code if the storage key does not exist. The latest standard library converts
  this error code back to a `None`
  value. This allows differentiating non-existent and empty storage entries.
- Make `Instance::from_module`, `::from_wasmer` and `::recycle` crate-internal.
- Create explicit, public `Checksum` type to identify Wasm blobs.
- `CosmCache::new` now takes supported features as an argument.
- Rename `VmError::RegionTooSmallErr` to `VmError::RegionTooSmall`.
- Rename `VmError::RegionLengthTooBigErr` to `VmError::RegionLengthTooBig`.
- Change property types to owned string in `VmError::UninitializedContextData`,
  `VmError::ConversionErr`, `VmError::ParseErr` and `VmError::SerializeErr`.
- Remove `VmError::IoErr` in favour of `VmError::CacheErr`.
- Simplify `VmError::CompileErr`, `VmError::ResolveErr` and
  `VmError::WasmerRuntimeErr` to just hold a string with the details instead of the source error.
- Remove `VmError::WasmerErr` in favour of the new `VmError::InstantiationErr`.
- The snafu error builders from `VmError` are now private, i.e. callers can only use the errors, not create them.
- `VmError` is now `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- Split `VmError::RuntimeErr` in `VmError::BackendErr` and
  `VmError::GenericErr`; rename `VmError::WasmerRuntimeErr` to
  `VmError::RuntimeErr`.
- Add `Instance.with_querier` analogue to `Instance.with_storage`.

## 0.7.2 (2020-03-23) {#072-2020-03-23}

**cosmwasm**

- Fix JSON schema type of `Binary` from int array (wrong) to string (right).
- Make `Extern` not `Clone`able anymore. Before cloning led to copying the data for mock storage and copying a stateless
  bridge for the external storage, which are different semantics.
- Remove public `cosmwasm::imports::dependencies`. A user of this library does not need to call this explicitely.
  Dependencies are created internally and passed as an argument in `exports::do_init`, `exports::do_handle` and
  `exports::do_query`.
- Make `ExternalStorage` not `Clone`able anymore. This does not copy any data, so a clone could lead to unexpected
  results.

## 0.7.1 (2020-03-11) {#071-2020-03-11}

**cosmwasm_vm**

- Avoid unnecessary panic when checking corrupted wasm file.
- Support saving the same wasm to cache multiple times.

## 0.7.0 (2020-02-26) {#070-2020-02-26}

**cosmwasm**

- Rename `Slice` to `Region` to simplify differentiation between Wasm memory region and serde's `from_slice`
- Rename `Params` to `Env`, `mock_params` to `mock_env` for clearer naming (this is information on the execution
  environment)
- `Response.log` is not a vector of key/value pairs that can later be indexed by Tendermint.

**cosmwasm_vm**

- Remove export `cosmwasm_vm::read_memory`. Using this indicates an architectural flaw, since this is a method for host
  to guest communication inside the VM and not needed for users of the VM.
- Create new type `cosmwasm_vm:errors::Error::RegionTooSmallErr`.
- Change return type of `cosmwasm_vm::write_memory` to `Result<usize, Error>` to make it harder to forget handling
  errors.
- Fix missing error propagation in `do_canonical_address`, `do_human_address`
  and `allocate`.
- Update error return codes in import `c_read`.
- Rename imports `c_read`/`c_write` to `read_db`/`write_db`.
- Rename imports `c_canonical_address`/`c_human_address` to
  `canonicalize_address`/`humanize_address`.
- Add `cosmwasm_vm::testing::test_io` for basic memory allocation/deallocation testing between host and guest.
- Make `ValidationErr.msg` a dynamic `String` including relevant runtime information.
- Remove export `check_api_compatibility`. The VM will take care of calling it.
- Let `check_api_compatibility` check imports by fully qualified identifier
  `<module>.<name>`.
- Make gas limit immutable in `cosmwasm_vm::instance::Instance`. It is passed once at construction time and cannot
  publicly be manipulated anymore.
- Remove `take_storage`/`leave_storage` from `cosmwasm_vm::Instance`.

## 0.6 {#06}

[Define canonical address callbacks](https://github.com/confio/cosmwasm/issues/73)

- Use `&[u8]` for addresses in params
- Allow contracts to resolve human readable addresses (`&str`) in their json into a fixed-size binary representation
- Provide mocks for unit testing and integration tests

- Separate out `Storage` from `ReadOnlyStorage` as separate traits

## 0.5 {#05}

### 0.5.2 {#052}

This is the first documented and supported implementation. It contains the basic feature set. `init` and `handle`
supported for modules and can return messages. A stub implementation of `query` is done, which is likely to be
deprecated soon. Some main points:

- The build-system and unit/integration-test setup is all stabilized.
- Cosmwasm-vm supports singlepass and cranelift backends, and caches modules on disk and instances in memory (lru cache)
  .
- JSON Schema output works

All future Changelog entries will reference this base
