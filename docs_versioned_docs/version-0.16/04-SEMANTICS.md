# Contract Semantics

This document aims to clarify the semantics of how a CosmWasm contract interacts with its environment. There are two
main types of actions: _mutating_ actions, which receive `DepsMut` and are able to modify the state of the blockchain,
and
_query_ actions, which are run on a single node with read-only access to the data.

## Execution

In the section below, we will discuss how the `execute` call works, but the same semantics apply to any other _mutating_
action - `instantiate`, `migrate`,
`sudo`, etc.

### SDK Context

Before looking at CosmWasm, we should look at the (somewhat under-documented)
semantics enforced by the blockchain framework we integrate with - the
[Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk). It is based upon the
[Tendermint BFT](https://tendermint.com/core/) Consensus Engine. Let us first look how they process transactions before
they arrive in CosmWasm (and after they leave).

First, the Tendermint engine will seek 2/3+ consensus on a list of transactions to be included in the next block. This
is done _without executing them_. They are simply subjected to a minimal pre-filter by the Cosmos SDK module, to ensure
they are validly formatted transactions, with sufficient gas fees, and signed by an account with sufficient fees to pay
it. Notably, this means many transactions that error may be included in a block.

Once a block is committed (typically every 5s or so), the transactions are then fed to the Cosmos SDK sequentially in
order to execute them. Each one returns a result or error along with event logs, which are recorded in the `TxResults`
section of the next block. The `AppHash` (or merkle proof or blockchain state)
after executing the block is also included in the next block.

The Cosmos SDK `BaseApp` handles each transaction in an isolated context. It first verifies all signatures and deducts
the gas fees. It sets the "Gas Meter"
to limit the execution to the amount of gas paid for by the fees. Then it makes an isolated context to run the
transaction. This allows the code to read the current state of the chain (after the last transaction finished), but it
only writes to a cache, which may be committed or rolled back on error.

A transaction may consist of multiple messages and each one is executed in turn under the same context and same gas
limit. If all messages succeed, the context will be committed to the underlying blockchain state and the results of all
messages will be stored in the `TxResult`. If one message fails, all later messages are skipped and all state changes
are reverted. This is very important for atomicity. That means Alice and Bob can both sign a transaction with 2
messages: Alice pays Bob 1000 ATOM, Bob pays Alice 50 ETH, and if Bob doesn't have the funds in his account, Alice's
payment will also be reverted. This is just like a DB Transaction typically works.

[`x/wasm`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/tree/master/x/wasm) is a custom Cosmos SDK module, which processes certain
messages and uses them to upload, instantiate, and execute smart contracts. In particular, it accepts a properly signed
[`MsgExecuteContract`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/master/proto/cosmwasm/wasm/v1beta1/tx.proto#L76-L89),
routes it to
[`Keeper.Execute`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/master/x/wasm/keeper/keeper.go#L311-L355), which loads the
proper smart contract and calls `execute` on it. Note that this method may either return a success (with data and
events) or an error. In the case of an error here, it will revert the entire transaction in the block. This is the
context we find ourselves in when our contract receives the `execute`
call.

### Basic Execution

When we implement a contract, we provide the following entry point:

```rust
pub fn execute(
  deps: DepsMut,
  env: Env,
  info: MessageInfo,
  msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {}
```

With `DepsMut`, this can read and write to the backing `Storage`, as well as use the `Api` to validate addresses,
and `Query` the state of other contracts or native modules. Once it is done, it returns either `Ok(Response)` or
`Err(ContractError)`. Let's examine what happens next:

If it returns `Err`, this error is converted to a string representation
(`err.to_string()`), and this is returned to the SDK module. _All state changes are reverted_ and `x/wasm` returns this
error message, which will _generally_
(see submessage exception below) abort the transaction, and return this same error message to the external caller.

If it returns `Ok`, the `Response` object is parsed and processed. Let's look at the parts here:

```rust
pub struct Response<T = Empty>
  where
    T: Clone + fmt::Debug + PartialEq + JsonSchema,
{
  /// Optional list of "subcalls" to make. These will be executed in order
  /// (and this contract's subcall_response entry point invoked)
  /// *before* any of the "fire and forget" messages get executed.
  pub submessages: Vec<SubMsg<T>>,
  /// After any submessages are processed, these are all dispatched in the host blockchain.
  /// If they all succeed, then the transaction is committed. If any fail, then the transaction
  /// and any local contract state changes are reverted.
  pub messages: Vec<CosmosMsg<T>>,
  /// The attributes that will be emitted as part of a "wasm" event
  pub attributes: Vec<Attribute>,
  pub data: Option<Binary>,
}
```

In the Cosmos SDK, a transaction returns a number of events to the user, along with an optional data "result". This
result is hashed into the next block hash to be provable and can return some essential state (although in general client
apps rely on Events more). This result is more commonly used to pass results between contracts or modules in the sdk.
Note that the `ResultHash` includes only the `Code` (non-zero meaning error) and `Result` (data) from the transaction.
Events and log are available via queries, but there are no light-client proofs possible.

If the contract sets `data`, this will be returned in the `result` field.
`attributes` is a list of `{key, value}` pairs which will be
[appended to a default event](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/master/x/wasm/types/types.go#L302-L321). The final
result looks like this to the client:

```json
{
  "type": "wasm",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "contract_addr",
      "value": "cosmos1234567890qwerty"
    },
    {
      "key": "custom-key-1",
      "value": "custom-value-1"
    },
    {
      "key": "custom-key-2",
      "value": "custom-value-2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Dispatching Messages

Now let's move onto the `messages` field. Some contracts are fine only talking with themselves, such as a cw20 contract
just adjusting its balances on transfers. But many want to move tokens (native or cw20) or call into other contracts for
more complex actions. This is where messages come in. We return
[`CosmosMsg`, which is a serializable representation](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/v0.14.0-beta4/packages/std/src/results/cosmos_msg.rs#L18-L40)
of any external call the contract can make. It looks something like this (with
`stargate` feature flag enabled):

```rust
pub enum CosmosMsg<T = Empty>
  where
    T: Clone + fmt::Debug + PartialEq + JsonSchema,
{
  Bank(BankMsg),
  /// This can be defined by each blockchain as a custom extension
  Custom(T),
  Staking(StakingMsg),
  Distribution(DistributionMsg),
  Stargate {
    type_url: String,
    value: Binary,
  },
  Ibc(IbcMsg),
  Wasm(WasmMsg),
}
```

If a contract returns two messages - M1 and M2, these will both be parsed and executed in `x/wasm` _with the permissions
of the contract_ (meaning
`info.sender` will be the contract not the original caller). If they return success, they will emit a new event with the
custom attributes, the `data` field will be ignored, and any messages they return will also be processed. If they return
an error, the parent call will return an error, thus rolling back state of the whole transaction.

Note that the messages are executed _depth-first_. This means if contract A returns M1 (`WasmMsg::Execute`) and
M2 (`BankMsg::Send`), and contract B (from the `WasmMsg::Execute`) returns N1 and N2 (eg. `StakingMsg` and
`DistributionMsg`), the order of execution would be **M1, N1, N2, M2**.

This may be hard to understand at first. "Why can't I just call another contract?", you may ask. However, we do this to
prevent one of most widespread and hardest to detect security holes in Ethereum contracts - reentrancy. We do this by
following the actor model, which doesn't nest function calls, but returns messages that will be executed later. This
means all state that is carried over between one call and the next happens in storage and not in memory. For more
information on this design, I recommend you read
[our docs on the Actor Model](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/0.13/architecture/actor.html).

### Submessages

As of CosmWasm 0.14 (April 2021), we have added yet one more way to dispatch calls from the contract. A common request
was the ability to get the result from one of the messages you dispatched. For example, you want to create a new
contract with `WasmMsg::Instantiate`, but then you need to store the address of the newly created contract in the
caller. With `submessages`, this is now possible. It also solves a similar use-case of capturing the error results, so
if you execute a message from eg. a cron contract, it can store the error message and mark the message as run, rather
than aborting the whole transaction. It also allows for limiting the gas usage of the submessage (this is not intended
to be used for most cases, but is needed for eg. the cron job to protect it from an infinite loop in the submessage
burning all gas and aborting the transaction).

This makes use of `CosmosMsg` as above, but it wraps it inside a `SubMsg`
envelope:

```rust
pub struct SubMsg<T = Empty>
  where
    T: Clone + fmt::Debug + PartialEq + JsonSchema,
{
  pub id: u64,
  pub msg: CosmosMsg<T>,
  pub gas_limit: Option<u64>,
  pub reply_on: ReplyOn,
}

pub enum ReplyOn {
  /// Always perform a callback after SubMsg is processed
  Always,
  /// Only callback if SubMsg returned an error, no callback on success case
  Error,
  /// Only callback if SubMsg was successful, no callback on error case
  Success,
}
```

What are the semantics of a submessage execution. First, we create a sub-transaction context around the state, allowing
it to read the latest state written by the caller, but write to yet-another cache. If `gas_limit` is set, it is
sandboxed to how much gas it can use until it aborts with `OutOfGasError`. This error is caught and returned to the
caller like any other error returned from contract execution (unless it burned the entire gas limit of the transaction).
What is more interesting is what happens on completion.

If it return success, the temporary state is committed (into the caller's cache), and the `Response` is processed as
normal (an event is added to the current EventManager, messages and submessages are executed). Once the
`Response` is fully processed, this may then be intercepted by the calling contract (for `ReplyOn::Always`
and `ReplyOn::Success`). On an error, the subcall will revert any partial state changes due to this message, but not
revert any state changes in the calling contract. The error may then be intercepted by the calling contract (
for `ReplyOn::Always` and
`ReplyOn::Error`). _In this case, the messages error doesn't abort the whole transaction_

#### Handling the Reply

In order to make use of `submessages`, the calling contract must have an extra entry point:

```rust
#[entry_point]
pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: Reply) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {}

pub struct Reply {
  pub id: u64,
  /// ContractResult is just a nicely serializable version of `Result<SubcallResponse, String>`
  pub result: ContractResult<SubcallResponse>,
}

pub struct SubcallResponse {
  pub events: Vec<Event>,
  pub data: Option<Binary>,
}
```

After the `submessage` is finished, the caller will get a chance to handle the result. It will get the original `id` of
the subcall so it can switch on how to process this, and the `Result` of the execution, both success and error. Note
that it includes all events returned by the submessage, which applies to native sdk modules as well (like Bank) as well
as the data returned from below. This and the original call id provide all context to continue processing it. If you
need more state, you must save some local context to the store (under the `id`)
before returning the `submessage` in the original `execute`, and load it in
`reply`. We explicitly prohibit passing information in contract memory, as that is the key vector for reentrancy
attacks, which are a large security surface area in Ethereum.

The `reply` call may return `Err` itself, in which case it is treated like the caller errored, and aborting the
transaction. However, on successful processing,
`reply` may return a normal `Response`, which will be processed as normal - events added to the EventManager, and
all `messages` and `submessages`
dispatched as described above.

The one _critical difference_ with `reply`, is that we _do not drop data_. If
`reply` returns `data: Some(value)` in the `Response` object, we will overwrite the `data` field returned by the caller.
That is, if `execute` returns
`data: Some(b"first thought")` and the `reply` (with all the extra information it is privy to)
returns `data: Some(b"better idea")`, then this will be returned to the caller of `execute` (either the client or
another transaction), just as if the original `execute` and returned `data: Some(b"better idea")`. If `reply`
returns `data: None`, it will not modify any previously set data state. If there are multiple submessages all setting
this, only the last one is used (they all overwrite any previous `data` value). As a consequence, you can use
`data: Some(b"")` to clear previously set data. This will be represented as a JSON string instead of `null` and handled
as any other `Some` value.

#### Order and Rollback

Submessages (and their replies) are all executed before any `messages`. They also follow the _depth first_ rules as
with `messages`. Here is a simple example. Contract A returns submessages S1 and S2, and message M1. Submessage S1
returns message N1. The order will be: **S1, N1, reply(S1), S2, reply(S2), M1**

Please keep in mind that submessage `execution` and `reply` can happen within the context of another submessage. For
example
`contract-A--submessage --> contract-B--submessage --> contract-C`. Then
`contract-B` can revert the state for `contract-C` and itself by returning `Err`
in the submessage `reply`, but not revert contract-A or the entire transaction. It just ends up returning `Err` to
contract-A's `reply` function.

Note that errors are not handled with `ReplyOn::Success`, meaning, in such a case, an error will be treated just like a
normal `message` returning an error. This diagram may help explain. Imagine a contract returned two submesssage - (a)
with `ReplyOn::Success` and (b) with `ReplyOn::Error`:

| processing a) | processing b) | reply called | may overwrite result from reply | note                                              |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ok            | ok            | a)           | a)                              | returns success                                   |
| err           | err           | none         | none                            | returns error (abort parent transaction)          |
| err           | ok            | none         | none                            | returns error (abort parent transaction)          |
| ok            | err           | a)b)         | a)b)                            | if both a) and b) overwrite, only b) will be used |

## Query Semantics

Until now, we have focused on the `Response` object, which allows us to execute code in other contracts via the actor
model. That is, each contract is run sequentially, one after another, and no nested calls are possible. This is
essential to avoid reentrancy, which is when calling into another contract can change my state while I am in the middle
of a transaction.

However, there are many times we need access to information from other contracts in the middle of processing, such as
determining the contract's bank balance before sending funds. To enable this, we have exposed the _read only_ `Querier`
to enable _synchronous_ calls in the middle of the execution. By making it read-only (and enforcing that in the VM
level), we can prevent the possibility of reentrancy, as the query cannot modify any state or execute our contract.

When we "make a query", we serialize a
[`QueryRequest` struct](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/v0.14.0-beta4/packages/std/src/query/mod.rs#L27-L48)
that represents all possible calls, and then pass that over FFI to the runtime, where it is interpretted in the `x/wasm`
SDK module. This is extensible with blockchain-specific custom queries just like `CosmosMsg` accepts custom results.
Also note the ability to perform raw protobuf "Stargate" queries:

```rust
pub enum QueryRequest<C: CustomQuery> {
  Bank(BankQuery),
  Custom(C),
  Staking(StakingQuery),
  Stargate {
    /// this is the fully qualified service path used for routing,
    /// eg. custom/cosmos_sdk.x.bank.v1.Query/QueryBalance
    path: String,
    /// this is the expected protobuf message type (not any), binary encoded
    data: Binary,
  },
  Ibc(IbcQuery),
  Wasm(WasmQuery),
}
```

While this is flexible and needed encoding for the cross-language representation, this is a bit of mouthful to generate
and use when I just want to find my bank balance. To help that, we often use
[`QuerierWrapper`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/v0.14.0-beta4/packages/std/src/traits.rs#L148-L314), which
wraps a `Querier` and exposes a lot of convenience methods that just use
`QueryRequest` and `Querier.raw_query` under the hood.

You can read a longer explanation of the
[`Querier` design in our docs](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/0.13/architecture/query.html).
