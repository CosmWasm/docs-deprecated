# Blockchain Infrastructure

Blockchain infrastructure is different from traditional systems.
In traditional web services it usually follows this: Frontend application interacts with Backend.

Blockchain infrastructure is similar to this but has different aspects and components integrated.

Here is an illustration for explaining:

Frontend either speaks directly to blockchain network,
or interacts with backend which is in connection with blockchain network.

A blockchain network needs a collection of computers to store and verify data. These computers are called nodes, which are connected and building blocks, verifying transactions. Each node has a copy of the data that has been stored on the blockchain since its inception and it gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added.
Whole operation rely on the blockchain in the middle, other services are built around that.
For example, backend infra can save information to an external database to serve complex queries.
