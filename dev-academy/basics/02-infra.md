# Blockchain Infrastructure

Blockchain infrastructure is different from traditional systems.
In traditional web services it usually follows this: Frontend application interacts with Backend.

Blockchain infra is similar to this but has different aspects and components integrated.

Here is an illustration for explaining:

Frontend either speaks directly to blockchain network,
Or interacts with backend which is in connection with blockchain network.

Blockchain network contains nodes which are connected and building blocks, verifies transactions.
Whole operation rely on the blockchain in the middle, other services are built around that.
For example, backend infra can save information to an external database to serve complex queries.
