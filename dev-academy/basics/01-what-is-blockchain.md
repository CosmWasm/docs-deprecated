# What is Blockchain?

The answer to this question is pretty long complicated, but its core concept is really quite simple. Here are few key points:

- Blockchain is a specific type of database.
- It differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in groups, known as blocks, that are then
  chained together.
- As new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data it is chained onto the
  previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
- Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain but the most common use so far has been as a ledger
  for transactions.
 In Bitcoin’s case and many more cases, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control—rather,
  all users collectively retain control.
- Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. This means
  that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.
