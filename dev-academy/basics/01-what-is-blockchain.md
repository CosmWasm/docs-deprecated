# What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a specific type of database made up of *blocks* of data, concatenated together to form a *chain*.

Specifically, new data comes in piece by piece in the form of *transactions*.
Each transaction is added to a block. Each block is chained to the previous block, creating a chronological ordering of data.

While blockchains can store any type of data, the most common use is to produce a *ledger*, i.e., an append-only list of transactions. For example, Bitcoin's blockchain stores all the transactions from one *wallet* (account) to every other. The balance of each account is a reduce over these transactions.


Blockchains use cryptography and distributed computing algorithms to provide *immutability*, meaning that the data stored on the chain cannot be altered after the fact. For a distributed digital ledger (e.g. Bitcoin) this means that the transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.
