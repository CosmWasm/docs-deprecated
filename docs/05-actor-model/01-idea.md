# Idea behind an Actor Model

The actor model is the solution to the problem of communication between smart
contracts. Let's take a look at the reasons why this particular solution is
chosen in CosmWasm, and what are the consequences of that.

## The problem {#problem}

Smart contracts can be imagined as sandboxed microservices. Due to SOLID
principles it is valuable to split responsibilities between entities.
However, to split the work between contracts themselves, there is a need
to communicate between them, so if one contract is responsible for
management group membership, it is possible to call its functionality
from another contract.

The traditional way to solve this problem in SW engineering is to
model services as functions that would be called with some RPC
mechanism, and return its result as a response. Even though this approach
looks nice, it creates sort of problems, in particular with shared state
consistency.

The other approach which is far more popular in business level modelling
is to treat entities as actors, which can perform some task, but without
interrupting it with calls to other contracts. Any calls to other contracts can
be called only after the whole execution is performed. When
"subcall" would be finished, it will call the original contract back.

This solution may feel unnatural, and it requires to kind of
different design solutions, but it turns out to work pretty well for
smart contracts execution. I will try to explain how to reason about it,
and how it maps to contract structure step by step.

## The Actor {#actor}

The most important thing in the whole model is an Actor itself. So
what is this? The Actor is a single instantiation of a contract,
which can perform several actions. When the actor finishes his job,
he prepares a summary of it, which includes the list of things
that have to be done, to complete the whole scheduled task.

An example of an actor is the Seller in the KFC restaurant. The first
thing you do is order your BSmart, so you are requesting 
action from him. So from the system user, you can think
about this task as "sell and prepare my meal", but the
action performed by the seller is just "Charge payment and create
order". The first part of this operation is to create a bill and
charge you for it, and then it requests the Sandwich and Fries
to be prepared by other actors, probably chefs. Then when the chef
is done with his part of the meal, he checks if all meals are ready.
If so, it calls the last actor, the waiter, to deliver the food
to you. At this point, you can receive your delivery, and the task
is considered complete.

The above-described workflow is kind of simplified. In
particular - in a typical restaurant, a waiter would observe the
kitchen instead of being triggered by a chef, but in the Actor model,
it is not possible. Here, entities of the system are passive
and cannot observe the environment actively - they only react to
messages from other system participants. Also in KFC, the seller
would not schedule subtasks for particular chefs, instead, he
would leave tasks to be taken by them, when they are free. It
is not the case, because as before - chefs cannot actively listen
to the environment. However, it would be possible to create a contract
for being a chefs dispatcher which would collect all orders from
sellers, and balance them across chefs for some reason.

## The Action {#action}

Actors are the model entities, but to properly communicate with
them, we need some kind of protocol to communicate with them.
Every actor is capable of performing several actions. In my
previous KFC example, the only action seller can do is "Charge
payment and create order". However, it is not always the case -
our chefs were proficient with performing both "Prepare fries"
and "Prepare Sandwich" actions - and also many more.

So when we want to do something in an actor system, we schedule
some action to the actor being the closest to us, very often with
some additional parameters (as we can pick if we want to exchange
fries with salad).

However, naming the action after the exact thing which happened
in the very contract would be misleading. Take a look at the KFC
example once again. As I mentioned, the action performed by a seller
is "Charge payment and create order". The problem is, that for
the client which schedules this action, it doesn't matter what
exactly is the responsibility of the actor himself - what the client is
scheduling is "Prepare Meal" with some description
of what exactly to prepare. So we can say, that the action is
the thing performed by the contract itself, plus all the sub-actions it
schedules.

## Multi-stage Actions {#multi-stage}

So as the whole idea makes some sense, there is the problem created by the actor
model: what if I want to perform some action in my contract, but to completely
finalize some steps, the contract has to make sure that some sub-action he
scheduled are finished?

Imagine, that in the previous KFC situation there is no dedicated
Waiter, instead Seller is serving you meal when Chefs finished
their job.

This kind of pattern is so important and common, that in CosmWasm
we developed a special way to handle it, which is dedicated `Reply`
action.

So when Seller is scheduling actions for chefs, he assigns some
number to this action (like order id) and passes it to chefs.
He also remembers how many actions he scheduled for every order id.
Now every time chef is finished with his action, he would call the
special `Reply` action on Seller, in which he would pass back the
order id. Then Seller would decrease the number of actions left for
this order, and if it reached zero, he would serve a meal.

Now you can say, that the `Reply` action is completely not needed,
as Chefs could just schedule any arbitrary action on Seller, like
`Serve`, why there is the special `Reply` for? The reason is
abstraction and reusability. The Chefs task is to prepare a meal,
and that is all. There is no reason for him to know why he is
even preparing Fries - if it is part of the bigger task (like order
for a client), or the seller is just hungry. It is possible,
that not only the seller is eligible to call the chef for food - possibly
any restaurant employee can do that just for themselves. Therefore,
we need a way, to be able to react an actor finishing his job in
some universal way, to handle this situation properly in any context.

It is worth noting, that the `Reply` can contain some additional data.
The id assigned previously is the only required information in the
`Reply` call, but the actor can pass some additional data - `events`
emitted, which are mostly metadata (to be observed by non-blockchain
applications mostly), and any arbitrary data it wants to pass.

## State {#state}

Up until this point, we were considering actors as entities performing
some job, like preparing the meal. If we are considering computer
programs, such a job would be to show something on the screen, maybe
print something. This is not the case with Smart Contracts. The only
thing which can be affected by the Smart Contract is their internal
state. So the state is arbitrary data that is kept by the contract.
Previously in the KFC example I mentioned, that Seller is keeping in mind
how many actions he scheduled for chefs are not yet finished - this
number is part of the Seller's state.

To give a more realistic example of a contract state, let's think about a more
real-life Smart Contract than the restaurant. Let's imagine we want
to create our currency - maybe we want to create some smart
contracts-based market for some MMORPG game. So we need some way,
to be able to at least transfer currency between players. We can
do that, by creating the contract we would call `MmoCurrency`,
which would support the `Transfer` action to transfer money to another
player. Then what would be the state of such a contract? It would be
just a table mapping player names to the amount of currency they own. The
contract we just invited exists in CosmWasm examples, and it
is called `cw20-base` contract (it is a bit more complicated, but
it is its core idea).

And now there is a question - how is this helpful to transfer currency
if I cannot check how much of it I own? It is a very good
question, and the answer to that is simple - the whole state of every
contract in our system is public. It is not universal for
every Actor model, but it is how it works in CosmWasm, and it is
kind of forced by the nature of blockchain. Everything happening in
blockchain has to be public, and if some information should be hidden,
it has to be stored indirectly.

There is one very important thing about the state in CosmWasm, and it is
the state being transactional. Any updates to the state are not applied immediately,
but only when the whole action succeeds. It is very important, as
it guarantees that if something goes wrong in the contract, it is always
left in some proper state. Let's consider our `MmoCurrency` case. Imagine,
that in `Transfer` action we first increase the receiver currency amount
(by updating the state), and only then do we decrease the sender amount.
However, before decreasing it, we need to check if a sender
possesses enough funds to perform the transaction. In case we realize,
that we cannot do it, we don't need to do any rolling back by hand -
we would just return a failure from the action execution, and the state
would not be updated. So when in contract state is updated,
it is just a local copy of this state being altered, but the
partial changes would never be visible by other contracts.

## Queries {#queries}

There is one building block in CosmWasm approach to the Actor model, which
I didn't yet cover it. As I said, the whole state of every contract is public
and available for everyone to look at. The problem is, that this way of
looking at state is not very convenient - it requires users of contracts
to know its internal structure, which kind of violates the SOLID rules
(Liskov substitution principle in particular). If for example contract
is updated and its state structure changes a bit, another contract looking
at its state would just nevermore work. Also, it is often the case, that
the contract state is kind of simplified, and information that is relevant
to the observer would be calculated from the state.

This is where queries come into play. Queries are the type of messages to
contract, which does not perform any actions, so do not update any state,
but can return an answer immediately.

In our KFC comparison, the query would be if Seller goes to Chef to ask
"Do we still have pickles available for our cheeseburgers"? It can be
done while operating, and response can be used in it. It is
possible because queries can never update their state, so they do not need
to be handled in a transactional manner.

However, the existence of queries doesn't mean, that we cannot look at the contract's
state directly - the state is still public, and the technique of looking at them
directly is called `Raw Queries`. For clarity, non-raw queries are sometimes
denoted as `Smart Queries`.

## Wrapping everything together - transactional call flow {#flow}

So we touched on many things here, and I know it may be kind of confusing.
Because of that, I would like to go through some more complicated calls
to CosmWasm contract to visualize what the "transactional state" means.

Let's imagine two contracts:

1. The `MmoCurrency` contract mentioned before, which can perform `Transfer`
  action, allowing to transfer some `amount` of currency to some `receiver`.
2. The `WarriorNpc` contract, which would have some amount of our currency,
  and he would be used by our MMO engine to pay out the reward for some
  quest player could perform. It would be triggered by `Payout` action,
  which can be called only by specific client (which would be our game
  engine).

Now here is an interesting thing - this model forces us, to make our MMO
more realistic in terms of the economy that we traditionally see - it is
because `WarriorNpc` has some amount of currency, and cannot create
more out of nothing. It is not always the case (the previously mentioned
`cw20` has a notion of Minting for this case), but for sake of simplicity
let's assume this is what we want.

To make the quest reasonable for longer, we would make a reward for it
to be always between `1 mmo` and `100 mmo`, but it would be ideally
`15%` what Warrior owns. This means, that the quest would be worth
less for every subsequent player, until Warrior would be broke, left
with nothing, and will no longer be able to payout players.

So what would the flow look like? The first game would send a `Payout` message
to the `WarriorNpc` contract, with info on who should get the reward. Warrior
would keep track of players who fulfilled the quest, to not pay out
the same person twice - there would be a list of players in his state.
First, he would check the list looking for players to pay out - if he is
there, he would finish the transaction with an error.

However, in most cases the player would not be on the list - so then `WarriorNpc`
would add him to the list. Now the Warrior would finish his part of
the task, and schedule the `Transfer` action to be performed by `MmoCurrency`.

But there is the important thing - because `Transfer` action is actually
the part of the bigger `Payout` flow, it would not be executed on the original
blockchain state, but on the local copy of it, which has already applied
the player's list. So if the `MmoCurrency` would for any reason take a look
of `WarriorNpc` internal list, it would be already updated.

Now `MmoCurrency` is doing its job, updating the state of Warrior and
player balance (note, that our Warrior is here just treated as another player!).
When it finishes, two things may happen:

1. There was an error - possibly Warrior is out of cash, and it can nevermore
  pay for the task. In such case, none of the changes - neither updating the list
  of players succeeding, nor balance changes are not applied to the original
  blockchain storage, so they are like never happened. In the database world, it
  is denoted as rolling back the transaction.
2. Operation succeed - all changes on the state are now applied to blockchain,
  and any further observation of `MmoCurrency` or `WarriorNpc` by external
  the world would see updated data.

There is one problem - in this model, our list is not a list of players
who fulfilled the quest (as we wanted it to be), but the list of players
paid out (as in transfer failure, the list is not updated). We can do better.

## Different ways of handling responses {#responses}

Note, that we didn't mention a `Reply` operation at all. So why it was not
called by `MmoCurrency` on `WarriorNpc`? The reason is, that this operation
is optional. When scheduling sub-actions on another contract we may choose
when `Reply` how the result should be handled:

1. Never call `Reply`, action succeed regardless of the result
2. Never call `Reply`, succeed only if sub-action succeeded
3. Call `Reply` on success
4. Call `Reply` on failure
5. Always call `Reply`

So if we do not request `Reply` to be called by subsequent contract, it will
not happen. I silently assumed, that the sub-call is performed in mode `2`,
so if the sub-call fails, the whole action would fail. But it is possible to
just schedule some additional "optional" actions, which result doesn't
matter so much. Obviously in case such sub call fails, only
changes done by the original action would be stored on a blockchain, and all
changes created by the sub-call would be rolled back (so the sub-contract
never ends up in an improper state). It is probably a bit complicated for now,
but I promise it would be simple when you would do some practice with that.

Now let's take a look at handling results with `3`-`5` options. It is actually
interesting, that using `3`, even if the transaction is performed by sub-call
succeed, we may now take a look at the data it returned with `Reply`, and
on its final state after it finished, and we can still decide,
that action as a whole is a failure, in which case everything would
be rolled back - even currency transfer performed by external contract.

In particular, an interesting option is `4`. So if the contract would call
`Reply` on failure, we can decide to claim success, and commit a
transaction on the state if the sub call failed. Why it may be relevant
for us? Possibly because our internal list was supposed to keep the list of
players succeeding with the quest, not paid out! So if we have no more currency,
we still want to update the list! So we can choose to use the `4` or `1` response
handling method, to ensure that failure in the transfer would not discard
the whole transaction.

But if we could use `1` for that, why is `4` exist? It is useful sometimes.
Probably the most common cause is that in case of failure, we want to leave
a note about it. Also, it is possible, that we want to succeed only on
particular types of failure, but it is a way less likely case - unfortunately
failure of the contract is denoted in CosmWasm only by some arbitrary string,
so distinguishing failure reason would require parsing this string,
and it would be difficult to maintain this kind of contract.

In the end, you can see, that performing actions in CosmWasm is built
with hierarchical state change transactions. The sub-transaction can be
applied to the blockchain only if everything succeeds, but in case that
sub-transaction failed, only its part may be rolled back, end other
changes may be applied. It is very similar to how most database
systems work.
