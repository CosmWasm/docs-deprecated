# Installation

In this section, we will gear up your workhorse for developing, deploying and, enjoying smart contracts on Cosmos SDK.

## Go {#go}

You can setup golang following [official documentation](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki#working-with-go). The latest
versions of `wasmd`
require go version `v1.15`.

## Rust {#rust}

Assuming you have never worked with rust, you will first need to install some tooling. The standard approach is to
use `rustup` to maintain dependencies and handle updating multiple versions of
`cargo` and `rustc`, which you will be using.

### Installing Rust in Linux and Mac {#installing-rust-in-linux-and-mac}

First, [install rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Once installed, make sure you have the wasm32 target:

```shell
rustup default stable
cargo version
# If this is lower than 1.50.0+, update
rustup update stable

rustup target list --installed
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Installing Rust in Windows 10 {#installing-rust-in-windows-10}

First, download and execute `rustup-init.exe` from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
or [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

If requested, manually download and install Visual C++ Build Tools 2019,
from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ . Make sure "Windows 10 SDK" and "English language pack"
are selected.

Continue running `rustup-init.exe`, and proceed with the installation.

Optionally:

- Download and install [gvim](https://www.vim.org/download.php#pc), and modify the Env vars to add \<gvim folder\> to
  the PATH.
- Download and install [git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Modify the Env vars to add \<git
  folder\>\bin to PATH.
- Turn on Developer Mode (Settings -> Update and Security: For Developers) and enable Device Discovery, to be able to
  access the Windows 10 server through
  ssh (https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/how-to-win10-ssh-service.html#section-mssshserv-enable).

Install the wasm32 target:

```shell
rustup default stable
cargo version
# If this is lower than 1.51.0, update
rustup update stable

rustup target list --installed
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

For those new to rust, the `stable` channel comes out every 6 weeks with a stable release. The `nightly` channel is the
bleeding edge and not only is it a version or two ahead (for testing), but it allows some extra unstable features, whose
APIs may change. For compiling `wasm`, you will want to use `stable`. We use `nightly` to compile the runtime
for `wasmd`, which needs it for the singlepass compiler with gas metering and more.

## wasmd {#wasmd}

`wasmd` is the backbone of CosmWasm platform. It is the implementation of a Cosmoszone with wasm smart contracts
enabled.

This code was forked from the `cosmos/gaia` repository as a basis and then added x/wasm and cleaned up many
gaia-specific files. However, the wasmd binary should function just like gaiad except for the addition of the x/wasm
module.

If you intend to develop or edit a contract, you need wasmd.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd.git
cd wasmd
# replace the v0.16.0 with the most stable version on https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/releases
git checkout v0.16.0
make install

# verify the installation
wasmd version
```

:::info
 If you have any problems here, check your `PATH`. `make install` will copy `wasmd` to
`$HOME/go/bin` by default, please make sure that is set up in your `PATH` as well, which should be the case in general
for building Go code from source.
:::

## Using Testnets {#using-testnets}

Testing network [Oysternet](https://github.com/CosmWasm/testnets/tree/master/oysternet-1) is launched to save you of the
hassle of running a local network and speed up your development.

:::caution
Use go 1.15+ for compiling `wasmd` executable
:::

```shell
# clone wasmd repo
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd.git && cd wasmd

# oysternet runs on wasmd v0.16.0
git checkout v0.16.0

# build wasmd executable
make install
```

## Further Information on the Cosmos SDK {#further-information-on-the-cosmos-sdk}

These represent an instance of a blockchain that utilizes all of the stable features of
the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). As such, `wasmd` have all the same features (plus WASM smart
contracts obviously). If you'd like to learn more about accessing those features take a look at
the [Gaia docs](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/main/docs/gaia-tutorials). If you'd like to learn more about getting
started with the Cosmos SDK in general, take a look at the series of
[Tutorials](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/) that show how to build custom modules for application-specific
blockchains.

## Setting up your IDE {#setting-up-your-ide}

We will need a good editor to guide us through the experience. We highly recommend plugins that help you learn syntax,
especially when just starting rust. There are two free editor environments we recommend, choose the one that is more
familiar to you.

If you use VSCode ([Download link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) you just need to add the rust plugin. This
is the best supported environment for RLS (Rust Language Server) and uses the rust compiler to type-check all your code
on save. This gives the same error messages as the actual compiler would and highlights along the line of the code, but
it can be a bit slow to respond sometime (as it runs the compiler). It is quite good, and if you are used to VSCode, I
highly recommend it:

[RLS for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust)

The other option I can recommend it Intellij IDEA Community
Edition ([Download link](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)), along with the Rust Plugin. This has very nice and
quick support for many language features directly inline. In particular, it shows the inferred types along variables,
which can be very helpful, especially when working with (nested) generics. It catches most syntax errors very quickly,
but not all of them. Which means sometimes you have to look at the compile failures to find the errors. If you are
coming from another Intellij product (eg. Goland), I recommend this approach:

[RUST for Intellij](https://intellij-rust.github.io/)

There are many more editors out there and some have varying degrees of rust support, at least syntax highlighting, but I
would recommend trying one of the two above, especially if you are new to rust. Once you are confident in the language,
you can always use another editor and customize it to your liking.
