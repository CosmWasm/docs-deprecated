# Names and Addresses

Blockchains (almost?) all use addresses to identify external actors via a hash of a public key, and many newer ones
extended this to identify on-chain "smart contracts" with unique addresses as well. On chain, addresses are represented
by a use a concise, immutable binary format, typically 20 or 32 bytes long, often derived from a hashing function.
However, there are many human-readable representations of these binary addresses, which are shown to clients. For
example, [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) `bc1qc7slrfxkknqcq2jevvvkdgvrt8080852dfjewde450xdlk4ugp7szw5tk9`,
hex `0x8617E340B3D01FA5F11F306F4090FD50E238070D`
or [checksumned hex](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md) `0x5aAeb6053F3E94C9b9A09f33669435E7Ef1BeAed`
, and
even [large integers](https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2018/01/16/blockchains-how-to-steal-millions-in-264-operations/) `3040783849904107057L`
.

## Addr {#addr}

Addresses in Cosmos SDK are 20 character long strings, and contain security checks - such as chain-prefix in Bech32, and
checksums in Bech32 and checksummed hex (EIP55). Since CosmWasm is an extension of Cosmos SDK, it follows the same
address rules; wallets, smart contracts, modules have an identifier address with defined prefix. `cosmos1...` for
gaia, `wasm1...` for CosmWasm testnets.

For passing address to contracts, pass it as string and then validate the input to an: **Addr**
[Addr](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/v0.14.0/packages/std/src/addresses.rs#L31) is just a wrapper around
plain string that provides useful helper functions such as string validation to an address.

## Optional: Canonical Addresses {#optional-canonical-addresses}

There is another representation of an address that tackles the case of change of human representation, but this is rare.

For example Bitcoin [moved from Base58 to Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0173) encoding along with SegWit, and
Rise is also [moving from Lisk format to Bech32](https://medium.com/rise-vision/introducing-rise-v2-521a58e1e9de#41d5)
in the v2 upgrade.

This means that if `message.signer` is always the string address that signed the transaction and I use it to look up
your account balance, if this encoding ever changed, then you lose access to your account. We clearly need a stable
identifier to work with internally.

This is where we define a *Canonical Address*. This is defined to be stable and unique. That is, for one given account,
there is only ever one canonical address (for the life of the blockchain). We define a *canonical address* format that
potentially multiple string addresses can be converted to. It can be transformed back and forth without any changes

We define the *Canonical Address* as the binary representation used internally in the blockchain. This is what the
native tokens are indexed by and therefore must never change for the life of an account. This is the representation that
can be used for all **storage lookups** (if you use part of an address as the key in the storage).

## Naming {#naming}

More and
more, [human](https://app.ens.domains/about) [readable](https://docs.blockstack.org/core/naming/introduction.html) [names](https://iov.one)
are increasingly important in
blockchains [and beyond](https://hackernoon.com/everything-you-didnt-know-about-the-handshake-naming-system-how-this-blockchain-project-will-483464309f33)
.

At one point, we considered making names a first-class citizen of CosmWasm and using them everywhere in messages. Until
we realized that accounts can have no name until initialized, and we need a permanently stable *Address*. However, we
would still like names to be as central to the blockchain as possible. To this end, we can consider names as just
another form of *Address* albeit one that requires a contract query (with storage access) to resolve, not just a call to
a pure function.

This actual format and interfaces are still under discussion, and we are still working on
a [tutorial version of a name service](/tutorials/name-service/intro). However, for sake of argument,
imagine we agree
every *Address* that begins with `:` is a name to lookup with the name service, and other ones can be resolved directly
with the built-in blockchain resolution function. So when creating a transaction for an escrow, you could use
either `{"arbiter": "cosmos1qqp837a4kvtgplm6uqhdge0zzu6efqgujllfst"}` or `{"arbiter": ":alice"}`, performing the
resolution inside the contract rather than only in the client. Of course we would need a standard query format for name
service, and the calling contract would need to somehow know the address of the canonical name service contract to
resolve with, which is why this feature is still under discussion.

### DIDs {#dids}

*Note: it will likely be quite some time before this is fully implemented. It serves as design inspiration*

Let's keep imagining what is possible with *Human Names*, once we develop a solution to the name service issue. We could
not just use a reference to resolve a user address, but resolve a contract as well. Maybe we could dispatch a message to
an "ERC20" token contract not by its name, but by its *uniquely registered token ticker*. We would soon need to use some
way to distinguish the scope or context of a name. This is
where [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) could come in. Imagine the following message
format, that could be used either by a end-client or by a smart contract "actor":

```json
{
  "destination": "did:token:XRN",
  "msg": {
    "transfer": {
      "from": "did:account:alice",
      "to": "did:account:bob",
      "amount": "13.56"
    }
  }
}
```

This would not be some spec to be resolved client-side, but the actual interchange format used on the blockchain. So one
smart contract could also dispatch such a message in the course of execution. Do you like this idea?
