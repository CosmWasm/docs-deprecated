# Next Steps

This is a very simple example for the name service contract we developed, but it should show you what is possible, limited only by the wasm code you upload and the json messages you send. The next step is the
[Hijack Escrow tutorial](/tutorials/hijack-escrow/intro) where you will edit a smart contract to put a backdoor that enables a thief to steal funds.

- [Videos and Workshops](/tutorials/videos-workshops): We curated some video and workshop resources you can take a look
  at.
- [Learn](/tutorials/simple-option/intro) will demonstrate developing smart contracts from zero to production with step
  by step explanations, code snippets, scripts and more.
  * [Dev Academy](/dev-academy/intro) provides structured learning content for CosmWasm smart contracts and clients.
- [Terra Academy](https://academy.terra.money/courses/cosmwasm-smart-contracts-i): is a great tutorial series apart from
  here.
- [cw-awesome](https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-awesome): Curated CosmWasm resources.
- [cw-template](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template): CosmWasm starter project. Do not clone the repo,
  but rather follow the [README](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-template/blob/master/README.md) on how to use
  `cargo-generate` to generate your skeleton.
- [cw-plus](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus): Production grade, ready to secure billions, smart contracts.
  Maintained and developed actively by [Confio](https://confio.gmbh/). Community made high quality smart contracts are hosted here.
- [cw-contracts](https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts): Community made smart contracts. Contributions are
  welcome.
- [InterWasm DAO](https://github.com/InterWasm/DAO): DAO for CosmWasm. If you have a good
  project for the community and require funds or help, create an [IWP](https://github.com/InterWasm/DAO#interwasm-proposalsiwps).

Happy Hacking!
