# Simple State

State is where the smart contract works with saving and retrieving data. You can think of it much like a database interaction layer in a traditional application.

The most simple way of writing state is by writing a single item.

For example, in the `cw20-base` contract, `TokenInfo` is written when the contract is instantiated.

First, a `TokenInfo` type is declared in `state.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct TokenInfo {
    pub name: String,
    pub symbol: String,
    pub decimals: u8,
    pub total_supply: Uint128,
    pub mint: Option<MinterData>,
}
```

Then the storage is initialized:

```rust
pub const TOKEN_INFO: Item<TokenInfo> = Item::new("token_info");
```

In the contract, we see in the `instantiate` function how data can be saved to this:

```rust
let data = TokenInfo {
    name: msg.name,
    symbol: msg.symbol,
    decimals: msg.decimals,
    total_supply,
    mint,
};
TOKEN_INFO.save(deps.storage, &data)?;
```
