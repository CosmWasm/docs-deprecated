# Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a smart contract is relatively straightforward:

1. [Compile](/04-smart-contracts/02-components/09-compilation.md)
2. [Store on blockchain](/04-smart-contracts/02-components/10-deployment.md)
3. [Instantiate](/02-getting-started/05-interact-with-contract.md)
4. [Execute commands via Messages](/04-smart-contracts/02-components/01-message.md) or [Query](/04-smart-contracts/02-components/05-query.md) the contract
5. [Migrate](/04-smart-contracts/03-migration/01-migration.md) to handle version changes

More information on each of these individual elements in the lifecycle can be found on their respective pages.
