# Introduction

DeFi wave hit 2020 crypto scene with enourmous impact and brought excitement. 
High yields attracted everyone including institutional player attention, 
but there is another feeling crypto twitter has along with excitement: 
Anxiety of a single error in an unaudited Solidity code can break the system with a domino effect.
Not even mentioning the enourmous fees paid to execute just one smart contract.

One of the prospects of CosmWasm is providing a solid base to DeFi dApps. 

To prove this bold claim and show CosmWasm is the right path, we will demostrate a [simple option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)) contract and teach you along the way. 

::: info
Options are financial derivatives that give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price and date. 
:::

We demo-ed the contract for HackAtom V India participants in a workshop. 
You can open the recordings of the workshop to the side and follow the written tutorial. You can practice developing the contract by yourself or practice cheating with looking at the finished repo https://github.com/CosmWasm/simple-option.
