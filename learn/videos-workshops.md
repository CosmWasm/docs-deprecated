## Contract Composition Workshop - August 26, 2020

In this workshop, we chose the topic ¨Contract composition deep dive¨ as per our poll result.

1) We will show the basic staking derivative
2) And demonstrate how to wrap it in a CW20 token
3) Then we could use that token to interact with other contracts.
