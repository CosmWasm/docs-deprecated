# Bootstrap dApp

There are two approaches to bootstrap a new dApp: as a lerna package in the monorepo or as a standalone app.

## Monorepo template

With this approach, we'll create another lerna package in the `packages/` directory that will use the local `logic` and `design` packages as dependencies.

For that, you only need to copy the `_template` directory into `packages/` and rename it to `balance-checker`.

## Standalone template

👷 Coming soon!
