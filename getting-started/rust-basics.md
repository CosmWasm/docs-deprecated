# Rust Basics

## Learn More Rust

There are a number of standard references that most rust developers use. It is good to get acquainted with them, to get detailed explanations on language topics and the library APIs:

* ["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
* [Cargo Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) - make `cargo` your friend
* [Standard Library Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html)
* [Rust Docs](https://docs.rs/) - api docs for all external packages
* [Crates.io](https://crates.io) - package registry, look for libraries you want to import

If you want a directed training, you can start one of these paths:

* [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
* [Rustlings - small exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)
