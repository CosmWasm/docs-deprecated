## Coding Environment {#coding-environment}

### Rust and IDE {#rust-and-ide}

This section is a summary
of [Getting Started / Installation and Setting Up Environment](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/0.14/getting-started/installation).
You can go to the doc,
setup rust and preferred IDE then and come back here. We recommend using Intellij IDEA.

## Project Starter {#project-starter}

Project starter template repo is there for spinning new smart contract quickly. With one command, project layout, boiler
plate, git, and even Circle CI for auto testing/formatting/linting will be set up. Cool huh. Here is the
repo: [cosmwasm-template](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-template)

Assuming you have a followed section above, then the following should get you a new repo to start a contract:

First, install **cargo-generate**. Unless you did that before, run this line now:

`cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl`

Now, use it to create your new contract. Go to the folder in which you want to place it and run:

`cargo generate --git https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-template.git --name simple-option`

Initialize git repo:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Initial generation from cosmwasm-template"
```

Great, workstation is ready.
