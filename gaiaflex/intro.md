# Introduction

GaiaFlex proves the potential of a smart contract container at the heart of the Cosmos Hub. {synopsis}

One of the promises of CosmWasm is to enable flexible smart contract execution on Cosmos Hub. With CosmWasm on the Hub,
network participants can propose to deploy smart contracts, vote in governance to enable them, and achieve much greater
flexibility on the chain without chain halts.

In this section you will learn all the knowledge required to experience smart contract on the hub. This section will
only contain smart contract uploading, proposing, voting, and execution. If you are interested in smart contract
development, digest the [Getting Started](./../getting-started/intro.md) documentation.

We will use [cw20-base](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-plus/tree/v0.1.1/contracts/cw20-base) contract in this
section. Permisionless CW20 usage is already demonstrated in [Using Contracts](../learn/using-contracts/setup.md)
section. This document will build on top of that with adding one more layer: **Smart Contract functionality through
Governance module**
